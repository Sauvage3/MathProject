# MathProject
LORAN Simulator

Design Goals:

Inital Series:

<ol>
  <li>Create tkinter interface</li>
  <li>Allow user to place two points in interface</li>
  <li>Propgate circular waves from point</li>
  <li>Find hyperbola at n difference of distance from points(where n is integer given by user</li>
  <li>Display hyperbola features(center, distance between focii, equation(hidden))</li>
</ol>






Potential Augments:
<ol>
  <li>Make graph scaleable</li>
  <li>Add three points, to find intersection</li>
</ol>
